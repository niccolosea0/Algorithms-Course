# Algorithms Course (Coursera Part I) Repository

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the Algorithms, Part I course by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne on Coursera. The course covers fundamental algorithms and data structures, including sorting, searching, graphs, and strings.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, store my code implementations, and document my learning throughout the course.

## Contents
- **Assignments**: Solutions to programming assignments provided in the course.
- **Notes**: Summaries and key concepts from lectures and readings.
- **Practice**: Additional practice problems and exercises to reinforce understanding.

## Structure
- `/assignments`: Contains code for course assignments, organized by week or topic.
- `/notes`: Markdown files with summaries of key concepts and algorithms.
- `/practice`: Extra problems and experiments related to course material.

## How to Use
Each folder contains relevant files for assignments, notes, or practice problems. Code is written primarily in Java, following the course's requirements. Comments in the code explain the approach and logic used.

## Progress
This repository will be updated as I progress through the course. Each commit corresponds to a specific assignment, concept, or practice problem.

## Contact
For any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me via GitHub issues or my Coursera profile.
